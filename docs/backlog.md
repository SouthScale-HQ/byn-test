# BYN — Project Backlog

A running list of tasks, ideas, and improvements. Items are grouped by category and roughly prioritised within each group. Move items to the pre-launch checklist in `decisions.md` when they become blockers.

---

## 🔴 In progress / immediate

- [x] Set up Resend for transactional email (`noreply@bynapp.online` sending, welcome and round settled emails live)
- [x] Fix southscale.co.uk legal page routing (404 on `/legal/byn-privacy` and `/legal/byn-terms`)

---

## 🟣 User account management

- [x] **Delete Account button** — added to Profile tab with 60-day cooling-off period, confirmation email, and cancel option. Google account blocked from re-registration during cooling-off period.
- [x] **Privacy Policy link** — added to Profile tab linking to southscale.co.uk/legal/byn-privacy
- [x] **Terms of Service link** — added to Profile tab linking to southscale.co.uk/legal/byn-terms

## 📊 Data models & probability

- [ ] **MotoGP probability model** — similar to F1 model. Research free MotoGP data API (motogp.com/api or similar). Components: current season championship points (50%), previous season standings (30%), circuit/track history (20%). Only needed when MotoGP is activated — The Odds API doesn't cover it.
- [ ] **NASCAR probability model** — track history is especially important in NASCAR (drivers have very different strengths by track type: superspeedways, short tracks, road courses). Research free NASCAR data API. Components: current season points (40%), previous season (20%), track-specific history (40% — higher weight than other sports).
- [ ] **NBA probability model** — only needed if The Odds API doesn't cover NBA when activated in Oct 2026. BallDontLie API (balldontlie.io) is free and covers NBA standings and game results. Components: current season win % (50%), home/away record (20%), head-to-head recent form (30%).
- [ ] **Sports not on The Odds API** — EPL, La Liga, World Cup, NFL, ATP, WTA, The Open, Champions League are all covered by The Odds API with de-vigged bookmaker probabilities — no model needed, bookmaker odds are better than anything we'd build. Only build models for sports The Odds API doesn't cover (F1 ✅, MotoGP, NASCAR, potentially rugby/cricket leagues).
- [ ] **Six Nations / Premiership Rugby probability model** — research free rugby data API. Components: current tournament standings (50%), historical H2H between these two teams (30%), home advantage (20%).
- [ ] **IPL probability model** — research free cricket API (cricbuzz, cricketdata.org). Components: current tournament form (50%), venue/pitch history (30%), team H2H (20%).

- [x] **Reduce live odds API calls** — fixtures now cached in Supabase `round_fixtures` table. API called once per competition per round only. Subsequent loads (page refresh, re-navigation) read from cache. Cache valid for 24 hours. API skipped entirely if round already seeded (`cd.liveSeeded === true`).
- [x] **F1 alternative odds source** — Uses OpenF1 (free, no API key) via `/api/f1-fixtures.js` serverless function. Shows all 20 drivers with full names and team names (e.g. "Lando Norris · McLaren"). Probability model combines: current 2026 season points (50%), 2025 final standings (30%), circuit-specific history (20%). Loads on app mount and refreshes automatically on next round. API-Sports free plan does not include current season data.
- [ ] **F1 demo simulation limitation** — live F1 fixture data loads correctly for the current round but does not carry through to the next round in the demo simulator. The simulated next round falls back to mock data (8 drivers, abbreviations). This is a demo-only issue — in production, real rounds advance based on actual race weekends so the fixture will always be fresh. Low priority — accept as a known demo limitation until real round advancement is built.

## 🟠 Backend

- [ ] **Apple Sign In** — required before App Store submission (App Store Guideline 4.8)
- [ ] **Stripe integration** — league slot purchases (packs of 3), company-sponsored leagues
- [ ] **Scheduled jobs** — server-side lockout enforcement (currently demo button only), auto-settlement after results come in, weekly topup at round start
- [ ] **Real bot management** — remove bot simulation from App.jsx before go-live (see pre-launch checklist)
- [ ] **Transfer Supabase** to SouthScale business account once incorporated
- [ ] **Server-side ad verification** — verify ad completion via ad network callback before crediting nuts (currently client-side only)
- [ ] **Push notifications** — lockout reminders, settlement alerts (mobile only, defer to native app)
- [ ] **Re-enable Odds API** — remove early `return []` in `oddsService.js` when ready to go live
- [ ] **Upgrade Odds API plan** — free tier is 500 requests/month, upgrade before live

---

## 🟡 Features

- [ ] **Ad network integration** — wire up Google AdMob (mobile) or Google Ad Manager (web) for the nuts boost ad views
- [ ] **Company-sponsored leagues** — businesses pay to create branded leagues, don't count against player cap
- [ ] **In-play market updates** — update prices during live events (requires websocket or polling)
- [ ] **Outright winner markets** — season-long competition winner (e.g. who wins the EPL) alongside weekly round markets
- [ ] **Position selling** — allow users to sell back a bet before lockout
- [ ] **Shareable result cards** — generate a shareable image after round settlement showing wins/losses
- [ ] **Stats page** — personal performance stats, best picks, historical balance charts
- [ ] **Notifications centre** — in-app notification history (round results, league activity)

---

## 🟢 Sports & competitions

- [ ] **Re-enable live odds** when EPL/La Liga/NFL seasons start (August/September) — odds API already wired, just remove the `return []`
- [ ] **Set real season lengths** — EPL = 38, La Liga = 38, NFL = 17, replace `SEASON_LENGTH_DEMO = 4`
- [ ] **MotoGP** — activate when API coverage available
- [ ] **NASCAR** — activate when API coverage available
- [ ] **NBA** — activate when NBA season starts (October)
- [ ] **ATP/WTA** — rename from Wimbledon to correct tournament name after Wimbledon ends
- [ ] **The Open** — rename PGA after The Open concludes
- [ ] **World Cup** — revert to `three_way` format (with Draw) for group stage next tournament
- [ ] **Champions League** — activate for 2026/27 season
- [ ] **Six Nations** — activate for 2027 tournament (February)
- [ ] **Rugby World Cup** — activate for 2027 tournament

## 🔵 UI / UX

- [ ] **Slow initial load** — Vercel edge cache headers added (repeat visits now instant). Bundle is 125KB gzipped. Further reduction options: replace `lucide-react` with inline SVGs (~50KB saving), or replace Supabase JS client with direct fetch calls (~150KB saving). Defer until user feedback indicates load time is a real problem.
- [x] **Round nuts to whole numbers** — `Math.round()` already applied consistently throughout the display layer. Confirmed no decimal values showing in UI.

## 🛠️ Internal admin & reporting

- [x] **Admin reporting dashboard** — live at southscale.co.uk/admin. Password protected. Shows users, bets, competitions, rounds, leagues, engagement, and platform health. Data pulled from Supabase via service role key through Vercel serverless function. Not linked publicly.

- [ ] **Remove demo simulator buttons** — "Simulate results", "Advance to lockout" etc. before go-live
- [x] **Landing page for bynapp.online** — live at bynapp.online root. App served at bynapp.online/app. Includes phone mockup, how it works, sports list, features, and App Store/Google Play placeholders.
- [ ] **Per-league ranking in settlement email** — round settled email currently shows balance and payout only. Add ranking breakdown per league the user is in (global, country, private leagues). Requires fetching user's league memberships from Supabase at settlement time and calculating their rank in each. Show as a table: "Global: 14th · England: 3rd · The Lads: 1st 🏆". and wired into market cards (betting and settled stages). Shows "Today 20:00", "Tomorrow 15:00", "Sat 12 Jul 17:30" etc. Working for F1 (confirmed). **Needs verification for football/tennis/golf once Odds API is re-enabled** — demo fixtures have no kickoff data so times only appear with live fixtures.
- [ ] **Bet history tab** — view all past bets within a competition, not just current round
- [ ] **Onboarding tour** — guided first-time user experience (highlight key features on first login)
- [ ] **Dark/light mode** — currently dark only
- [ ] **Profile photo** — pull from Google account and display in header
- [ ] **League chat** — simple message thread within a private league

- **Head-to-head challenges** — challenge a specific friend to the same market
- **Tipster leaderboard** — separate ranking for best single-round return (not cumulative)
- **Expert picks** — optional "pundit mode" where featured users' picks are highlighted
- **Watch party mode** — live updates during events showing how prices are moving in real time
- **BYN Wrapped** — end-of-season summary card (Spotify Wrapped style) showing your best moments
- **API for third-party leagues** — allow companies to embed a BYN league widget in their own apps
- **Crypto nuts** — optional NFT-backed nuts for users who want provable scarcity (much later, if ever)
