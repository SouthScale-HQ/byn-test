# BYN — Project Backlog

A running list of tasks, ideas, and improvements. Items are grouped by category and roughly prioritised within each group.

---

## 🟣 User account management

- [x] **Delete Account button** — added to Profile tab with 60-day cooling-off period, confirmation email, and cancel option.
- [x] **Privacy Policy link** — added to Profile tab linking to southscale.co.uk/legal/byn-privacy
- [x] **Terms of Service link** — added to Profile tab linking to southscale.co.uk/legal/byn-terms
- [ ] **Per-league ranking in settlement email** — round settled email currently shows balance and payout only. Add ranking breakdown per league the user is in (global, country, private leagues). Show as a table: "Global: 14th · England: 3rd · The Lads: 1st 🏆".

---

## 📊 Data models & probability

- [x] **Own probability models for all sports** — removed all dependency on The Odds API. Built in-house models for all competitions:
  - Football: FIFA rankings + ELO model (FIFA WC, Euros, EPL, La Liga, UCL)
  - Rugby (international): World Rugby rankings API (free) + H2H (Nations Championship ✅, Rugby Championship ✅, Six Nations ✅, Rugby WC ✅)
  - Rugby (club): Team strength ratings (URC ✅, Prem Rugby ✅, Super Rugby Pacific ✅)
  - F1: OpenF1 (free, no key) + championship standings probability model ✅
  - Tennis: ATP/WTA rankings + grass surface adjustment (Wimbledon ✅)
  - Golf: OWGR + course/links history (The Open ✅)
  - NFL: Team power ratings ✅
- [ ] **MotoGP probability model** — research free MotoGP data API. Components: championship points (50%), previous season (30%), circuit history (20%).
- [ ] **NASCAR probability model** — track history weighted heavily (40%). Research free NASCAR data API.
- [ ] **NBA probability model** — activate October 2026. BallDontLie API (free) covers standings and results. Components: win % (50%), home/away record (20%), H2H form (30%).
- [ ] **IPL probability model** — research free cricket API (cricbuzz, cricketdata.org). Components: form (50%), venue/pitch history (30%), H2H (20%).
- [ ] **F1 demo simulation limitation** — demo rounds always show current next real-world race. Expected behaviour — rounds advance with real race weekends in production.

---

## 🟠 Backend

- [ ] **Apple Sign In** — required before App Store submission (App Store Guideline 4.8)
- [ ] **Stripe integration** — league slot purchases (packs of 3), company-sponsored leagues
- [ ] **Scheduled jobs** — server-side lockout enforcement, auto-settlement after results, weekly topup at round start
- [ ] **Real bot management** — remove bot simulation from App.jsx before go-live
- [ ] **Transfer Supabase** to SouthScale business account once incorporated
- [ ] **Server-side ad verification** — verify ad completion via ad network callback before crediting nuts
- [ ] **Push notifications** — lockout reminders, settlement alerts (defer to native app)
- [ ] **Reminder cron job** — `reminders` table stores user reminders with `reminder_date` and `sent: false`. Need scheduled job to send email 7 days before fixture and mark `sent: true`. Options: Vercel Cron (Pro plan), GitHub Actions schedule, or Supabase pg_cron.
- [ ] **Set real season lengths** — EPL = 38, La Liga = 38, NFL = 17, replace `SEASON_LENGTH_DEMO = 4`
- [ ] **Remove demo simulator buttons** — "Simulate results", "Advance to lockout" before go-live

## 💡 Ideas (unvalidated)

- **Club partnership revenue share** — partner with amateur and lower-tier football clubs (League One, League Two, non-league) to drive user acquisition via a club code mechanism.
  - **Club code**: unique short code (e.g. `COVCITY`) assigned per partner club. Captured at sign-up (after Google OAuth, before profile creation). Stored as `club_code` on `profiles` table. Also passable as URL param `?club=COVCITY` to pre-fill.
  - **Revenue model**: BYN shares X% (suggest 20–30%) of all lifetime revenue from referred users — ad views, league slot purchases, future subscriptions. Club earns as long as their fans are active.
  - **Active user tracking**: define "active" as ≥1 bet placed in last 30 days. Monthly snapshot job queries `bets` grouped by `club_code`, counts distinct `user_id`. Store in `club_activity_snapshots` table (club_code, month, active_users, total_bets, estimated_revenue).
  - **Revenue attribution**: estimate per-user revenue as (ad views × rate) + (purchases × value). Apply club share % to get monthly payout per club.
  - **Club dashboard**: read-only page showing referred users, active count, estimated earnings — tab in southscale admin or separate partner portal.
  - **Scale path**: 2–3 pilot clubs → prove model → pitch to EFL → Premier League community trust departments.
  - **Key questions**: share % threshold, minimum payout amount, attribution window (lifetime vs rolling 12 months), handling users who enter multiple club codes.
  - **Marketing kit** — produce a ready-to-use pack for each partner club so they can promote BYN to their fanbase with minimal effort:
    - Email template (Resend-compatible HTML) pre-written with club name/logo slot, CTA linking to `bynapp.online?club=CLUBCODE`
    - Social media graphics (Instagram square, Twitter/X banner, Facebook cover) in BYN brand colours with club branding overlay
    - Digital matchday programme ad (A5 landscape, print-ready PDF)
    - Landing page variant at `bynapp.online/club/CLUBCODE` — co-branded, shows club name/crest, explains BYN, pre-fills club code at sign-up
    - WhatsApp/SMS template (short link + 1-line pitch) for fan groups and club comms
  - **Club portal** — lightweight web portal (could live at `partners.bynapp.online` or a tab in southscale admin) giving each club a read-only view of their performance:
    - Total referred users (all time)
    - Active users this month (placed ≥1 bet in 30 days)
    - Estimated revenue this month and cumulative
    - Monthly trend chart (active users and estimated earnings over time)
    - Their unique referral link and QR code for download
    - Pending and paid earnings history
    - Access via simple email-based login (magic link) — no password management needed

- **First-bet advert per round** — show an ad when a user places their first bet in a new betting round. High-engagement moment — user is invested and paying attention.
  - **Trigger**: detect `cd.bets.length === 0` before the bet is placed and `cd.stage === 'betting'`. After bet is confirmed, show ad modal before returning to market view.
  - **Format**: fullscreen overlay with 5-second countdown then "Continue" button. Or rewarded format where watching earns bonus nuts (aligns with existing ad boost mechanic).
  - **Frequency cap**: once per round per competition — not once per session. User playing EPL and Nations Championship sees at most 2 ads (one per competition's first bet).
  - **Implementation**: add `firstBetAdShown: false` to competition state. Set `true` after first ad shown. Reset on `nextRound()`.
  - **Revenue**: integrate with Google AdMob (mobile) or Google Ad Manager (web) when ready. Rewarded video typically £0.01–£0.05 per view.

- **Prediction streaks** — bonus nuts for consecutive correct predictions
- **Head-to-head challenges** — challenge a specific friend to the same market
- **Tipster leaderboard** — separate ranking for best single-round return (not cumulative)
- **Expert picks** — optional "pundit mode" where featured users' picks are highlighted
- **Watch party mode** — live updates during events showing how prices are moving
- **BYN Wrapped** — end-of-season summary card (Spotify Wrapped style)
- **API for third-party leagues** — allow companies to embed a BYN league widget
