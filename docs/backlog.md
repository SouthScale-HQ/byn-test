# BYN — Project Backlog

A running list of tasks, ideas, and improvements. Items are grouped by category and roughly prioritised within each group. Move items to the pre-launch checklist in `decisions.md` when they become blockers.

---

## 🔴 In progress / immediate

- [ ] Set up Resend for transactional email (`support@bynapp.online`, `noreply@bynapp.online`)
- [ ] Fix southscale.co.uk legal page routing (404 on `/legal/byn-privacy` and `/legal/byn-terms`)

---

## 🟣 User account management

- [ ] **Delete Account button** — add to Profile tab. On confirmation, schedule account for deletion after a 60-day cooling-off period. During this period the Google account cannot be reused to create a new BYN account. After 60 days, all personal data is purged from Supabase. User should receive a confirmation email at deletion request and a reminder before the 60 days expires. Required for GDPR compliance (right to erasure).

---

## 🟤 API & performance

- [ ] **Reduce live odds API calls** — the Odds API should only be called once per round at round start, to fetch fixtures and seed opening odds into the LMSR. After that, all pricing is driven by user bets. Currently the API is disabled during testing (`return []` in `oddsService.js`) but when re-enabled, add a check: only fetch if the current round has no bets placed yet and has not already been seeded (`cd.liveSeeded === false`). Cache the result in Supabase so re-fetching on page refresh doesn't cost API credits.

## 🟠 Backend

- [ ] **Apple Sign In** — required before App Store submission (App Store Guideline 4.8)
- [ ] **Stripe integration** — league slot purchases (packs of 3), company-sponsored leagues
- [ ] **Scheduled jobs** — server-side lockout enforcement (currently demo button only), auto-settlement after results come in, weekly topup at round start
- [ ] **Real bot management** — remove bot simulation from App.jsx before go-live (see pre-launch checklist)
- [ ] **Transfer Supabase** to SouthScale business account once incorporated
- [ ] **Server-side ad verification** — verify ad completion via ad network callback before crediting nuts (currently client-side only)
- [ ] **Push notifications** — lockout reminders, settlement alerts (mobile only, defer to native app)
- [ ] **Re-enable Odds API** — remove early `return []` in `oddsService.js` when ready to go live
- [ ] **Upgrade Odds API plan** — free tier is 500 requests/month, upgrade before live

---

## 🟡 Features

- [ ] **Ad network integration** — wire up Google AdMob (mobile) or Google Ad Manager (web) for the nuts boost ad views

---

## 🟢 Sports & competitions

## 🔵 UI / UX

- [ ] **Transfer Supabase** — to SouthScale business account post-incorporation

## 💡 Ideas (unvalidated)

- **Prediction streaks** — bonus nuts for consecutive correct predictions
- **Head-to-head challenges** — challenge a specific friend to the same market
- **Tipster leaderboard** — separate ranking for best single-round return (not cumulative)
- **Expert picks** — optional "pundit mode" where featured users' picks are highlighted
- **Watch party mode** — live updates during events showing how prices are moving in real time
- **BYN Wrapped** — end-of-season summary card (Spotify Wrapped style) showing your best moments
- **API for third-party leagues** — allow companies to embed a BYN league widget in their own apps
- **Crypto nuts** — optional NFT-backed nuts for users who want provable scarcity (much later, if ever)
