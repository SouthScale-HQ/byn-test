# BYN — Project Backlog

A running list of tasks, ideas, and improvements. Items are grouped by category and roughly prioritised within each group. Move items to the pre-launch checklist in `decisions.md` when they become blockers.

---

## 🔴 In progress / immediate

- [x] Set up Resend for transactional email (`noreply@bynapp.online` sending, welcome and round settled emails live)
- [x] Fix southscale.co.uk legal page routing (404 on `/legal/byn-privacy` and `/legal/byn-terms`)

---

## 🟣 User account management

- [x] **Delete Account button** — added to Profile tab with 60-day cooling-off period, confirmation email, and cancel option. Google account blocked from re-registration during cooling-off period.
- [x] **Privacy Policy link** — added to Profile tab linking to southscale.co.uk/legal/byn-privacy
- [x] **Terms of Service link** — added to Profile tab linking to southscale.co.uk/legal/byn-terms

---

## 🟤 API & performance

- [x] **Reduce live odds API calls** — fixtures now cached in Supabase `round_fixtures` table. API called once per competition per round only. Subsequent loads (page refresh, re-navigation) read from cache. Cache valid for 24 hours. API skipped entirely if round already seeded (`cd.liveSeeded === true`).
- [x] **F1 alternative odds source** — API-Sports integrated via `/api/f1-fixtures` serverless function. Provides real race name, circuit, date and driver list. Driver probabilities estimated from championship standings points. `API_SPORTS_KEY` stored in Vercel env vars. Will activate with Odds API when testing is complete.

## 🟠 Backend

- [ ] **Apple Sign In** — required before App Store submission (App Store Guideline 4.8)
- [ ] **Stripe integration** — league slot purchases (packs of 3), company-sponsored leagues
- [ ] **Scheduled jobs** — server-side lockout enforcement (currently demo button only), auto-settlement after results come in, weekly topup at round start
- [ ] **Real bot management** — remove bot simulation from App.jsx before go-live (see pre-launch checklist)
- [ ] **Transfer Supabase** to SouthScale business account once incorporated
- [ ] **Server-side ad verification** — verify ad completion via ad network callback before crediting nuts (currently client-side only)
- [ ] **Push notifications** — lockout reminders, settlement alerts (mobile only, defer to native app)
- [ ] **Re-enable Odds API** — remove early `return []` in `oddsService.js` when ready to go live
- [ ] **Upgrade Odds API plan** — free tier is 500 requests/month, upgrade before live

---

## 🟡 Features

- [ ] **Ad network integration** — wire up Google AdMob (mobile) or Google Ad Manager (web) for the nuts boost ad views
- [ ] **Company-sponsored leagues** — businesses pay to create branded leagues, don't count against player cap
- [ ] **In-play market updates** — update prices during live events (requires websocket or polling)
- [ ] **Outright winner markets** — season-long competition winner (e.g. who wins the EPL) alongside weekly round markets
- [ ] **Position selling** — allow users to sell back a bet before lockout
- [ ] **Shareable result cards** — generate a shareable image after round settlement showing wins/losses
- [ ] **Stats page** — personal performance stats, best picks, historical balance charts
- [ ] **Notifications centre** — in-app notification history (round results, league activity)

---

## 🟢 Sports & competitions

- [ ] **Re-enable live odds** when EPL/La Liga/NFL seasons start (August/September) — odds API already wired, just remove the `return []`
- [ ] **Set real season lengths** — EPL = 38, La Liga = 38, NFL = 17, replace `SEASON_LENGTH_DEMO = 4`
- [ ] **MotoGP** — activate when API coverage available
- [ ] **NASCAR** — activate when API coverage available
- [ ] **NBA** — activate when NBA season starts (October)
- [ ] **ATP/WTA** — rename from Wimbledon to correct tournament name after Wimbledon ends
- [ ] **The Open** — rename PGA after The Open concludes
- [ ] **World Cup** — revert to `three_way` format (with Draw) for group stage next tournament
- [ ] **Champions League** — activate for 2026/27 season
- [ ] **Six Nations** — activate for 2027 tournament (February)
- [ ] **Rugby World Cup** — activate for 2027 tournament

## 🔵 UI / UX

- [ ] **Slow initial load** — Vercel edge cache headers added (repeat visits now instant). Bundle is 125KB gzipped. Further reduction options: replace `lucide-react` with inline SVGs (~50KB saving), or replace Supabase JS client with direct fetch calls (~150KB saving). Defer until user feedback indicates load time is a real problem.
- [x] **Round nuts to whole numbers** — `Math.round()` already applied consistently throughout the display layer. Confirmed no decimal values showing in UI.

## 🛠️ Internal admin & reporting

- [x] **Admin reporting dashboard** — live at southscale.co.uk/admin. Password protected. Shows users, bets, competitions, rounds, leagues, engagement, and platform health. Data pulled from Supabase via service role key through Vercel serverless function. Not linked publicly.

- [ ] **Remove demo simulator buttons** — "Simulate results", "Advance to lockout" etc. before go-live
- [x] **Landing page for bynapp.online** — live at bynapp.online root. App served at bynapp.online/app. Includes phone mockup, how it works, sports list, features, and App Store/Google Play placeholders.
- [ ] **Kickoff time display** — `formatKickoff()` function built and wired into market cards (betting and settled stages). Shows "Today 20:00", "Tomorrow 15:00", "Sat 12 Jul 17:30" etc. **Needs verification once Odds API is re-enabled** — demo fixtures have no kickoff data so times only appear with live fixtures.
- [ ] **Bet history tab** — view all past bets within a competition, not just current round
- [ ] **Onboarding tour** — guided first-time user experience (highlight key features on first login)
- [ ] **Dark/light mode** — currently dark only
- [ ] **Profile photo** — pull from Google account and display in header
- [ ] **League chat** — simple message thread within a private league

## ⚙️ Infrastructure & accounts

- [x] **Set up Resend** — `noreply@bynapp.online` sending, welcome email and round settled email wired up
- [ ] **Set up Google Workspace** or confirm M365 suffices for all business email needs
- [ ] **Incorporate SouthScale** — Companies House registration (£50, 24-48 hours)
- [ ] **Update legal documents** — add registered address and company number once incorporated
- [ ] **Transfer Supabase** — to SouthScale business account post-incorporation
- [ ] **GDPR / ICO registration** — register with ICO as a data controller (required if processing UK personal data commercially, £40/year for small organisations)
- [ ] **App Store Connect account** — set up Apple Developer account ($99/year) to begin iOS submission process
- [ ] **Google Play Console account** — set up for Android submission ($25 one-time)

## 💡 Ideas (unvalidated)

- **Prediction streaks** — bonus nuts for consecutive correct predictions
- **Head-to-head challenges** — challenge a specific friend to the same market
- **Tipster leaderboard** — separate ranking for best single-round return (not cumulative)
- **Expert picks** — optional "pundit mode" where featured users' picks are highlighted
- **Watch party mode** — live updates during events showing how prices are moving in real time
- **BYN Wrapped** — end-of-season summary card (Spotify Wrapped style) showing your best moments
- **API for third-party leagues** — allow companies to embed a BYN league widget in their own apps
- **Crypto nuts** — optional NFT-backed nuts for users who want provable scarcity (much later, if ever)
